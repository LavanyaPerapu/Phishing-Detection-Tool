This project is a machine learning-based phishing website detection system that classifies URLs as either legitimate or phishing. It aims to help users and organizations stay safe from online fraud by analyzing URL patterns and characteristics to detect malicious intent.
🔍 Features
Extracts features from URLs such as:
URL length
Presence of special characters
Use of HTTPS
Number of subdomains
Uses supervised machine learning algorithms like:
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Preprocessing and feature extraction using Python
Model evaluation and accuracy testing
Option to integrate into a web-based or desktop application
🎯 Goal
To build an intelligent and efficient tool that can automatically detect phishing URLs with high accuracy, reducing user exposure to phishing scams.
🧠 Technologies Used
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab (for training & testing)
